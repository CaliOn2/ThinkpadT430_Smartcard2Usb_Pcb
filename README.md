# ThinkpadT430_Smartcard2Usb_Pcb
this is a small pcb meant to convert the Thinkpad T430 smartcard reader into an internal usb-c* port
I've Finished the design and have tested a hand wired version of it on a breadboard however I still have to order the pcb and see if it works and if the form factor fits
