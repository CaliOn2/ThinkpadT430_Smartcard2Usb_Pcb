# ThinkpadT430_Smartcard2Usb_Pcb
this is a small pcb meant to convert the Thinkpad T430 smartcard reader into an internal usb-c* port
I've Finished the design and have tested a hand wired version of it on a breadboard however I still have to order the pcb and see if it works and if the form factor fits

*(The usb port is equivalent to a usb-A port and thus lacks support for a lot of the advanced features of a usb-c connection such as voltage modulation)
